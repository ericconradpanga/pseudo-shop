# Final Project Retrospective

## Team Members
- Student 1: Eric Conrad Panga
- Student 2: Jericho Paolo Dolendo

## 1. How did you divide the work between you and your partner?
_(Who worked on which features? How was the work assigned or negotiated?)_

We divided tasks based on personal preference and made sure they were independent to avoid overlap. I worked on features 1 and 3, which focused on product functionality, while Jericho handled features 2 and 4 related to user authentication and UI.

## 2. What Git strategies or commands helped you most during the project?
_(E.g., branching, rebasing, frequent commits, etc.)_

The feature branch workflow helped us the most because it allowed us to work on separate branches without affecting each other’s progress. This made merging easier and reduced the chances of conflicts.

## 3. Describe a merge conflict you encountered. What caused it and how did you resolve it?
_(Include any lessons learned or techniques used to resolve the issue.)_

We simulated a merge conflict by editing the same line in main.pseudo. It happened because I intentionally didn’t pull the latest changes before pushing. We resolved it by manually reviewing the conflict, discussing which version to keep, and updating the file accordingly.

## 4. What were the biggest challenges you faced as a team?
_(This can include communication, Git usage, or coordination.)_

Our biggest challenge was planning the task assignments so we could work efficiently under time pressure. We made sure that each person could work independently, with very few shared dependencies.

## 5. What did you learn about using Git in a collaborative setting?
_(Any insights or habits you’d apply in future projects?)_

We learned that communication and proper use of branches are key to successful collaboration. Committing regularly and pulling often helped keep our work in sync.

## 6. How would you improve your workflow next time?
_(Think about technical habits and teamwork practices.)_

Next time, we could make use of tools like GitHub Issues to track tasks and features, so responsibilities are clearer. We could also comment more on pull requests and use shared notes or documents for better planning and coordination.

## 7. Optional: Any feedback on the activity?
_(What worked well? What was confusing or could be improved?)_

This project helped us develop stronger Git habits and taught us the value of teamwork, planning, and communication. It gave us a better understanding of how to manage collaboration in real development environments.
